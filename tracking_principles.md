# Our tracking principles
Presiding over our implementation of Amplitude through GTM, we have defined 4 guiding principles (AAAA) around what tracking should be :

## 1. Autonomy 
A good tracking is a tracking that teams can maintain in autonomy, without undue dependances on other teams or individual contributors. At ManoMano we invested massively in educating the teams to this new approach to tracking and the tools and they should be autonomous. Tracking is not someone's job: it's everyone's.

## 2. Accessibility 
Related to the above, not only do we believe everyone should be responsible for tracking, we also want to make sure that *they are able to*. That means designing and giving trainings to everyone once, and then again and again to newbies. It also means that when choosing tools we will always go for the more intuitive options, the one that requires 1h of training and not 4. This has been a decisive factor for the choice of GTM and Amplitude.

## 3. Agility 
In the world of Product Management, agility is much preached concept. We want our tracking to be just like our roadmap: to adapt to new challenges and changing priorities. We have accepted the fact that our tracking will never be exhaustive and that's OK. We also have provided our teams with a process that allow them to rapidly fill the gaps in their tracking with very short iterrations.

## 4. Agnosticity
We want to build a tracking system that's above all passing trends and hot new tools. In our work we aim for agnosticity from products and solutions. Google Tag Manager and Amplitude appeared as the best joint solutions when we first designed our process but we want to remain free to migrate to whatever new tool the market offer us. When thinking about tracking, our hands should never be tied by the choices we made historically.
